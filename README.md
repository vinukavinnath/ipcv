This repository contains a collection of image processing and computer vision tutorials created under the supervision of [Dr. Kaneeka Vidanage](https://foc.kdu.ac.lk/computer_science/dr-kaneeka-vidanage/). The tutorials cover various topics, from basic shape detection to complex image classification tasks using deep learning models.


## Table of Contents

1. Shape Detection
2. Face Recognition
3. Vehicle Number Plate Detection
4. Object Detection with MobileNet
5. Pneumonia Detection with VGG16
6. Gun Detection with VGG16
7. Multiclass Image Classification

### Shape Detection
This tutorial covers the basics of shape detection using OpenCV. It includes code for set of preprocessing tasks and identify the shape using contours in an image.

### Face Recognition
Demonstrates face recognition using OpenCV's pre-trained models and face_recognition library. It explains how to detect faces in an image and recognize known individuals.

### Vehicle Number Plate Detection
This tutorial focuses on detecting vehicle number plates using OpenCV and easy_ocr. It covers image preprocessing, plate detection, and character recognition.

### Object Detection with MobileNet
Explains how to use the MobileNet SSD model for object detection. It includes steps for loading the model, processing images, and identifying objects in real-time.

### Pneumonia Detection with VGG16
This tutorial uses the VGG16 deep learning model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using transfer learning techniques.

### Gun Detection with VGG16
Similar to the pneumonia detection tutorial, this one uses the VGG16 model to detect guns in images. It includes steps for training the model and making predictions.

### Multiclass Image Classification
This tutorial demonstrates how to perform multiclass image classification using CIFAR10 dataset and campares ANN and CNN characteristics.
